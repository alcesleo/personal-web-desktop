Personal Web Desktop
====================

A window-manager written in JavaScript with a couple of simple apps.

I wrote this in the beginning of my education, when hadn't really begun using
version control, so this is mostly just an upload of the project.

The files in the `php`-directory was given to us as part of the assignment, and so were the pictures.

I do believe that the JS-code is still pretty decent, and I like how it turned out. I might come back here.
